    "## Introduction\n",
    "As part of the Coursera Data Science Capstone project, I will be using Python and Coursera to analyse the number of Italian restaurants by postcode in the Greater London area.   This is to aid in the understanding of the relative density of restaurants to then inform entrepreneurs as to the area with the greatest opportunity for new restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "London has one of the greatest plethora of restaurants in the world, with hundreds of new restaurants opening every month in the capital, however being a highly competitive market, there are also hundreds of restaurants that close every month.  Understanding the \"right\" location to launch a new restaurant is an important decision for any restaurateur.  This piece of analysis will be focused on Italian restaurants, to limit the immediate scope and to test the functionality of the tool, however the analysis could be broadened at a late time to cater to a users desired input cuisine."
